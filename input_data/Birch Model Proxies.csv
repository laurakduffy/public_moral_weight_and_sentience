1: possession of nociceptors,2: possession of integrative brain regions,3: possession of neural pathways connecting nociceptiorrs to brain regions,4: behavioural response modulated by chemical compounds,5: evidence of motivational trade-offs,6: flexible self-protective behaviour,7: evidence of associative learning,8: evidence that the animal values a putative analgesic/anaesthetic when injured,9: evidence of affective states
